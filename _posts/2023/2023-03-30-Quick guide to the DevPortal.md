### What is a Developer Portal?

A **Developer Portal** is a website that provides documentation, resources, and tools for you to learn, use, and integrate with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It is a centralised platform that offers you everything you need to work with an our APIs quickly and easily, including code samples, tutorials, SDKs (Software Development Kits), API reference documentation, testing tools, and community forums. It is also a platform that provides a clear and structured way for our developer community to collaborate, gather feedback, and manage the API lifecycle.

### Why does it matter?

A developer portal offers the following advantages:

1. **Increased API adoption:** By providing comprehensive documentation, resources, and tools, a developer portal helps to promote API adoption among developers.
2. **Improved developer experience:** A developer portal streamlines your experience of working with APIs. It provides clear and structured information and reduces the time and effort required to integrate with an API.
3. **Community building:** A developer portal can be used to build a community of developers that can provide valuable feedback, suggestions, and support.
